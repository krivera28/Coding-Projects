This is an example website that I used to teach 3rd to 5th Graders in GWC how to use Scratch
and the basics of website development.

I also created this personal website during the Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program I took part in. 
This remains partially incomplete due to the time constraints of taking the accelerated course, 
but I am happy with it because it was my first time working with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
